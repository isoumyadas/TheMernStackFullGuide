// Node js only runs JS file

console.log("hello");

// Window can't get executed in node js env. So all the window objects are not allowed

// Whenever we make servers for that we need to do:
// npm init => stands as npm initialize
// It creates a template or file to run a project
// package.json file is created
// It contains all the information about the project
// We can install packages using "npm install package-name"

// npm start helps to run the project when we add the script/Json in the package.json
// We can give anyname but you should follow the standard industry code.
