/* 

    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;

    here, justify-content center mean horziantally center
    and align-items center mean vertically center | use flex-end instead of end do this for every flex.

    **Flex-direction**
        This helps you to set direction of your content
        we've column, row, column-reverse, row-reverse

    **flex-wrap**
        This helps to wrap the items into container, if they overflowing or you want set view for mobile verison
    
    **align-content**
        align-items aligns individual items within a line, while align-content aligns the entire group of lines when thereâ€™s extra space in the cross-axis.
            you've flex-start,end,center

    **GAP**
        gap is used to add space between the items, you can use gap in both row and column
            this is been written in container

    you've column-gap and row-gap


    ---------------------------------------------------------

    item property
        **Order**
            if the order value this higher then it will lay afterwards and if it is less than it will lay before.
            
            order: 3 -> denotes higher
            order: 1 -> denotes lower
            0 is the default value

        **Flex-grow**
            This is used to increase the size of the item, if the space is available.
            if the value is 0 then it will not increase the size of the item.
        
            eg: 
            flex-grow: 1 -> means it will increase the size of the item by 1
            flex-grow: 2 -> meand it will increase the size of the item by 2

       **Flex-shrink**
        flex-shrink works like if you kept the value as  
            flex-shrink: 2; -> then it will shrink 2x faster than than items. remember this property should be added to items not container. for eg: item-1

        **Align-self**
        This is used to align the item to the container, if the align-items is not set.
        you've flex-start, center, end, baseline, stretch
        this will work for independent items.

        **flex basis**
        This is used to set the initial size of the item, if the space is available.
